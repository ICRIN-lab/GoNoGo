# GoNoGo
GoNoGo Task 

In many experiment paradigms, people’s response speed and accuracy is measured. In some paradigms people’s capacity not to respond is tested. One of these paradigms is known as Go/No-go paradigms (see also Go/No-go on wikipedia). Typically, in some conditions participants have to respond, while in other conditions they are asked not to respond.

In this version, you just see the text Go or No go. When you see Go, you need to respond within 2 seconds. When you see No-go, you need to make sure you do not press the button (for 2 seconds).

This task is made a bit more difficult because there are more Go than No-go trials. You will see that when Go trials repeat, you get faster. But then, when a No-Go trial comes, you might not be able to stop.

</br>Gordon and Caramazza claimed that the go/no-go procedure resulted in better performance and data that were less noisy than data from the two-choice procedure.
